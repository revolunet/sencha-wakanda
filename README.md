Sencha + Wakanda demos
======

The revolunet team worked to create a Wakanda proxy for the Sencha frameworks (ExtJS 4 and Sencha Touch 2)

You can now declare and use remote wakanda models as any Sencha model.

Please read the [Wiki page for full details](https://github.com/revolunet/sencha-wakanda/wiki/Wakanda-REST-API-with-ExtJS-4)

Folders inside the repo :

 - example : sample wakanda project that use Sencha widgets with Wakanda REST resources

 - extjs : sencha proxy, reader & writer and WakandaModel source code

This is for demo purpose, enjoy, comment and fork :)
